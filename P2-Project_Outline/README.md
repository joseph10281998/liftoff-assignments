## Submission Instructions

### Overview
 The user story I made was "As a manager, I want to create a survey form app whether my team members are satisfied with their work environment so that I could help them to stay in this workplace."
 Upon this user story, I would make a very small survey app.

 What will your app do? : This simple app could provide the decision tool for managers. 
 What might users find useful about it? : Users could feel useful becuase this app provides the numeric standards, which are helpful for managerial decisions. 
 Where did the idea come from? I got this idea from the book that one retired CEO wrote.
